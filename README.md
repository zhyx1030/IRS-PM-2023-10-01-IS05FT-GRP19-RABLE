## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

RABLE (Rebalancing Data with a Generative Method for Imbalanced Partial Label Learning) is an innovative machine learning project designed to tackle the complexities of handling uncertain and imbalanced data labels. This project introduces a novel approach, the RABLE model, which capitalizes on label ambiguity to enhance partial label learning using contrastive techniques.

Furthermore, RABLE incorporates generative methods to rebalance data distributions, effectively addressing the challenges of imbalanced data. In experimental trials conducted on the CIFAR-10 dataset, RABLE surpasses the baseline ABLE model, demonstrating its potential to yield more accurate predictions in scenarios where fully labeled data is limited.

To facilitate understanding and engagement, an interactive website has been created, offering users the opportunity for hands-on experience with partial label image classification. RABLE serves as a valuable bridge between cutting-edge research and practical applications, showing promise in improving the performance of machine learning models in real-world scenarios.
